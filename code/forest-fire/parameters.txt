# Area related
G (hxw double): Comfort of walking
F (hxw double): Strength of fire [0, 1]

# Parameter to system
Gmax   (double): Maximum G
Gzero  (double): Initial G
Gburnt (double): G of area when fire has gone away
                 (Set G to Gburnt when fire burns out, ie. F = 0)
dF     (double): Fire step
                 (Initial F when fire spreads into cell is 1,
                  decreases by dF per time step)

# Local variables (only inside functions)
r_a (1x2 double): Agent position

# General progression of system
dt (double)    : Time step per iteration
t  (double)    : Time

x  (double)    : Grid position (column no.) [1..100 etc]
y  (double)    : Grid position (row no.) [1..100 etc]
