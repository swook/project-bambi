## General Introduction

Our aim is to simulate a forest fire situation where inhabitants or animals flee
following forest paths formed by their trails.

With this study, we can save animals which are escaping from forest fires by
predicting their path. We can also define animal protection better by evaluating
the trails used, calculated with our model.

We can apply these mechanics to other problems such as human evacuations in
urban disasters.

Studies for human trail formation and forest fire spread are well established.
Our study aims to combine the two studies using relatable case studies.

(States your motivation clearly: why is it important / interesting to solve this problem?)
(Add real-world examples, if any)
(Put the problem into a historical context, from what does it originate? Are there already some proposed solutions?)

## The Model

### Independent Variables
- Forest fire spread rate.
- Wild animals and human velocities.
- Terrain parameters such as obstacle presence, elevation, and ground roughness.

### Dependent Variables
- Trail formed over time.
- Path taken in fire.
- Survival probability.

(Define dependent and independent variables you want to study. Say how you want to measure them.)
(Why is your model a good abstraction of the problem you want to study?)
(Are you capturing all the relevant aspects of the problem?)


## Fundamental Questions

- Will Bambi survive our forest fire?
- How well do living things survive forest fires and how useful are previously
  formed forest paths?

(At the end of the project you want to find the answer to these questions)
(Formulate a few, clear questions. Articulate them in sub-questions, from the more general to the more specific. )


## Expected Results

- Forest paths will be very useful in quick evacuation of forest fires.

(What are the answers to the above questions that you expect to find before starting your research?)
